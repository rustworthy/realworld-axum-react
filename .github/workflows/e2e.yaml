# This is a dedicated workflow similar to the one we've implemented earlier in 
# `wewerewondering` project. In there, is a Svelte-powered front-end with axum-powered
# backend, but the idea is fundamentally the same: we are launching chromedriver,
# building the front-end, serving this build from the otherwise API server, and
# use fantoccini to navigate the app and make assertions in the end-to-end test suite.
