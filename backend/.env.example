# In `Makefile` you will see how we are specifying username,
# password and database name when launching a local instance of PostgreSQL cluster.
# If you've launched a postgres container with other credentials or on
# different port, adjust the connection string in your `.env` accordingly

# The URL of the end-user facing part of the app. We will embed this into the messages
# we are sending to the them such as welcoming message, email confirmation letter,
# password reset letter, etc. If the front-end is served from a different origin,
# make sure to allos include this to the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` list.
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8005

# This is technically only required if the front-end is served on a different
# host and port, which is exactly how we are doing in development and in production.
# If you have changed the development port for the front-end, adjust here accordingly.

# Mailer configuration, if the transport is set to "stdout" and the app is running
# in debug mode, the emails will be simply printed to the console. The mailer services
# provider (e.g. Resend) normally requires from you to confirm you are owning/managing
# the domain specified in the "from" address; so for release environment, you are
# expected to have this configured already. You can also specify an override endpoint
# (which is great for proxied setups and testing) or just use the one in this example
# which is the Resend's well-known base URL.

# ------------------------------- OPTIONAL -------------------------------------
# Whether to run all the pending migrations at the app start-up.
# This is something which is almost always desired during the development phase.
# In production, though, we do not want each application process that we are
# starting to run migrations, rather only the fist container on the  primary host.
MIGRATE=true


# See `Makefile` on how to specify OTEL exporter endpoint (we are using
# Jaeger container locally including its UI). Just leave this blank to see
# "normal" logs in your terminal - this is much friendlier when developing.
# If you populate this variable, the logs will get a structured form and will 
# be exported to Jaeger (or whatever service you are trying to export to), so
# make sure to adjust the `RUST_LOG` variable (see below) to avoid noise.
# OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT=

# Note that you will most likely want to raise the bar when exporting
# telemetry data to a collector (e.g. setting this - like we are doing in prod
# environment - to "realworld_axum_react=info,axum=error")
# RUST_LOG=debug

# ------------------------------ OVERRIDES -------------------------------------
# Here you can store your temporary local overrides, if needed.
